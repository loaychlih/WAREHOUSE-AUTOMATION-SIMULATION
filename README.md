# WAREHOUSE-AUTOMATION-SIMULATION


## Overview

This project is a simulation of Kiva robots in a warehouse environment. The Kiva robots are autonomous mobile robots designed for material handling and warehouse automation. The simulation allows you to visualize and study the movement of Kiva robots within a grid-based warehouse, considering collision avoidance and other relevant factors.

## Features

- **Grid-based Warehouse:** The simulation is set in a grid-based warehouse environment, where Kiva robots navigate to perform various tasks.

- **Collision Avoidance:** The simulation takes into account collision avoidance mechanisms to ensure the safe movement of multiple robots within the warehouse.

- **Automatic Movement:** The Kiva robots in this simulation are programmed to efficiently retrieve chars from specific locations, deliver them to an operator station, and then autonomously return the chars to their original positions within the warehouse.
